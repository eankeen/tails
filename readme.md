# tails ðŸ¦Š

`tails` enables you to view, edit, and organize all your javascript projects in one place

if you're like me, you're tired of repeating the same boilerplate when creating spas, mpas, or just regular js apps. it also gets quite repetitive just to start an app: cd in a project subdirectory, lookup the start command, start the app, find the port, open the browser, and navigate to it. stuff like hot and auto reload don't come out of the box and have to be set up _every single time_. even if its just a few steps, it's quite monotonous. create-react-app, vue-cli, and the similar help out with *some* boilerplate, but the issue still persists. websites such as jsfiddle and codesandbox solve some issues, but the main drawback is that you must use the website code editor, rather than a normal one. also, your code is in a little iframe in the corner of the screen. inspecting element with iframes doesn't really work consistently. also, your projects are not tracked by any vcs and they are not stored on your computer. tails alleviates all these problems by allowing you to create, view, edit, and launch, your projects all in one place. creating projects via managed presets removes nearly all boilerplate code so you can just experiment with what you want to.

## goals

- main idea: paas for running *trusted* code (small-medium-sized codebases)
- use your standard ide tools to edit these projects
- view projects directly in browser
- browse through, label, sort, and manage all your javascript projects within the web interface
- start projects on demand, *quickly*
- have nice urls during development (no localhost and port crap, all managed for you)
- generate helm charts to run on kubernetes for prod
  - such that crap *just worksâ„¢*

## details

- proposed project types
  - web (static files)
  - spa (parcel, webpack, or rollup bundlers)
  - node
  - node + spa (parcel, webpack, or rollup bundlers)
  - deno
- ability to 'upgrade' web projects
  - ex. 'upgrade' web (static files) to node (importing `express` or `server-static`, etc.)
    - this copies rather than edits to prevent mistakes in upgrade process
  - ex. 'upgrade' (we w/ webpack bundler) + node to out-of-tails-project (since projects shouldn't inherently be tightly coupled to tails)
- the `projects` directory
  - flat tree structure of projects
- showing stdout / stderr
  - maybe have cli so we can just output crap in an existing pty
    - only for running it for testing it out (not for during development, since we have vscode console for that)
- linting / style formatting
  - option to have no linting or style formatting (meaning, the editor does everything)
  - or option to have prettier, eslint configs symlinked to project directory and have watch optiosn for auto update
  - should we make it easy to lint whole project and change linting of all projects, or just on single project basis? both?
    - reverting should be easy
  - or have combo wombo or something
- show generated metadata
  - how much browser support your website has
  - size of codebase gzipped, minified, etc.

### codebase

want the codebase to be as modular as possible, so we can just plug in different parts as needed. working towards a microservice-oriented architecture

want the following chunks

- frontend frontend
  - actual svelte frontend
- backend frontend
  - frontend to the actual backend server
- backend backend
  - actual package that performs project ops
- hosted backend
  - backend that only hosts the simple html,css,js projects

### development

- open any mount of subprojecs at once without conflicts
  - containerization of non web (static) sites
- nice domains during development
- cli?

### production

- choose which projects to deploy
- such that stable for production
- web page lists projects
  - click on project, start pods, services, and ingresses
