# tails ðŸ¦Š

`tails` enables you to view, edit, and organize all your programming projects in one place

**are you tried of**

- creating the same boilerplate when creating spas, mpas, or regular js apps
- cd in a project subdirectory, lookup the start command, start the app, find the port, open the browser, and navigate to it just to open up one of your side projects
- setting up hmr and and nodemon _every single time_
- using sites like jsfiddle, codesandbox, replit, etc. and
  - using the normie editor rather than your build in one, that you use locally
  - the code is not stored locally, and its stored on someone elses cloud
  - have the code output in some tiny iframe
  - changes not tracked under vcs, or if is, some weird vc-lite system

tails alleviates all these problems by allowing you to create, view, edit, and launch, your projects all in one place. creating projects via managed presets removes nearly all boilerplate code so you can just experiment with what you want to. babel and postcss plugin configuration is a click away, and so is project boillerplate setup including linting etc. this tool is inherently framework, utility, and ide agnostic, allowing you to plugin whatever drivers and modules you need to extend the feature set. all of this, with an automanaged, kubernetes-based one-click deploy solution. it's basically a super cute fully e2e customizable paas for *all* of your personal projects

what it looks like *now*
![tails preview](./tails.png)

## goals

- main idea: paas for running *trusted* code (small-medium-sized codebases)
- use your standard ide tools to edit these projects
- view projects directly in browser
- browse through, label, sort, and manage all your projects within the web interface
- start projects on demand, *quickly*
- have nice urls during development (no localhost and port crap, all managed for you)

## details

- proposed project types (more generic languages will come later)
  - web (static files)
  - spa (parcel, webpack, or rollup bundlers)
  - node
  - node + spa (parcel, webpack, or rollup bundlers)
- ability to 'upgrade' web projects
  - ex. 'upgrade' web (static files) to node (importing `express` or `server-static`, etc.)
    - this copies rather than edits to prevent mistakes in upgrade process
  - ex. 'upgrade' (we w/ webpack bundler) + node to out-of-tails-project (since projects shouldn't inherently be tightly coupled to tails)
- the `projects` directory
  - flat tree structure of projects
- showing stdout / stderr
  - maybe have cli so we can just output crap in an existing pty
    - only for running it for testing it out (not for during development, since we have vscode console for that)
- linting / style formatting
  - option to have no linting or style formatting (meaning, the editor does everything)
  - or option to have prettier, eslint configs symlinked to project directory and have watch optiosn for auto update
  - or have combo wombo or something
- show generated metadata
  - how much browser support your website has
  - size of codebase gzipped, minified, etc.
- development
  - open any mount of subprojecs at once without conflicts
  - containerization of non web (static) sites (idk maybe not actually)
  - nice domains during development
  - cli?
- production
  - choose which projects to deploy
  - web page lists projects
  - even those most of these are (probably) going to be throwaway test projects, would be cool to select and choose which ones go to prod and only have those deployed and visible in some sort of listing

## usage

not really streamlined yet; project still in early development (pre-alpha)
mostly focusing on fully managed javascript solutions
